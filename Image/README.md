LuckyNight is a Casino BlackJack game

The rules are as follows
 
Aces may be counted as 1 or 11 points

2 to 9 according are counted as face value

Tens and face cards count as ten points.

The value of a hand is the sum of the point values of the individual cards. Except, a "blackjack" is the highest hand, consisting of an ace and any 10-point card, and it outranks all other 21-point hands.

After the players have bet, the dealer will give two cards to each player and two cards to himself. One of the dealer cards is dealt face up the other face down. 

If the dealer has an ace showing, he will offer a side bet called "insurance." This side wager pays 2 to 1 if the dealer's hole card is any 10-point card. Insurance wagers are optional and may not exceed half the original wager. 

If the dealer has a ten or an ace showing (after offering insurance with an ace showing), then he will peek at his facedown card to see if he has a blackjack. If he does, then he will turn it over immediately. 

If the dealer does have a blackjack, then all wagers (except insurance) will lose, unless the player also has a blackjack, which will result in a push.

The following plays are available to the player: 

Stand: Player stands with their hand at current value. 

Hit: Player draws another card.

Double Down: Player doubles their bet and gets one, and only one, more card. 

Split: If the player has a pair, or any two 10-point cards, then he may double his bet and separate his cards into two individual hands. The dealer will automatically give each card a second card. Then, the player may hit, stand, or double normally. However, when splitting aces, each ace gets only one card. Sometimes doubling after splitting is not allowed.

If the dealer goes over 21 points, then any player who has not already busted will win. 

If the dealer does not bust, then the higher point total between the player and dealer will win.

If the dealer and player have the same hand then a push happens.

Winning wagers pay even money, except a winning player blackjack usually pays 3 to 1
